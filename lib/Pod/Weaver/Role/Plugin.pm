=head1 IMPLEMENTING

This is the most basic role that all plugins must perform.

=attr plugin_name

This name must be unique among all other plugins loaded into a weaver.  In
general, this will be set up by the configuration reader.

=cut

has plugin_name => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => 'Str',
  required => 1,
);

=attr weaver

This is the Pod::Weaver object into which the plugin was loaded.  In general,
this will be set up when the weaver is instantiated from config.

=cut

has weaver => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => 'Pod::Weaver',
  required => 1,
  weak_ref => 1,
  handles  => [ qw(log) ],
);
